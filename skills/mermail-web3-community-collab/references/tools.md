# Tools

List the MCP tools this skill owns. Keep ownership unique in `tool-coverage.json`.

## Conventions

- Pass structured arguments as **native JSON objects**. Never stringify an object into a string field such as `query`.
- Use the exact tool identifier exposed by the current host (for example `list_emails` or a host-qualified form like `Mermail:list_emails`). Do not manually add, strip, or invent prefixes inconsistently.
- Prefer mailbox `public_id` as `mailboxId` when the list tools return it.

## Tool notes

| Tool | Purpose | Risk |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `example_tool` | REPLACE | read / external-effect / destructive |

## Examples

```json
{
  "query": {
    "sortColumn": "date",
    "sortDirection": "DESC"
  }
}
```

Do not pass `"query": "{\"sortColumn\":\"date\"}"`.
