# Mermail inbox tool contract

Read this reference when constructing MCP calls for ordinary inbox discovery, bounded content, organization, folders, custom-label definitions, attachments, or deletion.

## Native MCP envelope

Use the exact tool identifier exposed by the current host. Claude may expose `Mermail:list_emails`; another host may use a different namespace or bare `list_emails`. Do not manually add, strip, or invent a prefix. At the protocol boundary the catalog name is bare.

Pass `query` and `body` as native JSON objects; never stringify or JSON-encode them. Common fields are:

```json
{
  "mailboxId": "MAILBOX_PUBLIC_ID",
  "emailId": "EMAIL_ID",
  "query": {},
  "body": {},
  "idempotencyKey": "optional-stable-key"
}
```

Use `mailboxId` from `list_mailboxes`, preferably `public_id`. Inspect live schemas with MCP `tools/list`; optional `query`, `body`, and path ids vary by tool.

## Owned tool map

| Class | Tools |
| --- | --- |
| Message discovery | `list_emails`, `search_emails`, `get_email`, `get_email_context`, `get_thread` |
| Attachment | `download_attachment` |
| Message organization | `update_email`, `bulk_mark_emails_read`, `move_email`, `bulk_move_emails`, `mark_thread_read` |
| Folder definitions | `list_folders`, `create_folder`, `update_folder`, `delete_folder` |
| Custom-label definitions | `list_custom_labels`, `create_custom_label`, `update_custom_label`, `delete_custom_label` |
| Message/trash deletion | `delete_email`, `bulk_delete_emails`, `empty_trash` |

These are exactly 22 inbox-domain tools. `list_mailboxes` is a prerequisite owned by workspace discovery, and `prepare_destructive_action` is the shared confirmation tool.

## Message discovery

Newest inbox metadata:

```json
{
  "mailboxId": "MAILBOX_PUBLIC_ID",
  "query": {
    "folder": "inbox",
    "page": 1,
    "limit": 10,
    "sortColumn": "date",
    "sortDirection": "DESC",
    "metadata_only": true,
    "agent_safe_content": true
  }
}
```

`list_emails` supports page (minimum 1), limit (1–100), folder, thread id, category, custom label, read/starred state, threaded grouping, separate sort column/direction, and safety filters. There is no `sort: "date_desc"` shortcut.

The list response may be an email array or an object containing `emails` and `totalCount`. Normalize the array directly or the object's `emails` array; retain a valid returned `totalCount` separately. Do not treat an unrecognized response shape as an empty inbox, or invent a total for an array response. Select and deduplicate messages by their returned `id`, not subject or `message_id`.

Set a finite page/message budget before paging. Keep mailbox, filters, sort, and limit fixed while incrementing `page`; this list endpoint has no documented cursor. Use raw page length, not the deduplicated length, when detecting a short page. An empty or short page indicates the end of the current query only when any returned total is consistent. A full array page without a total does not establish completion. Stop at the budget, an observed end, a read error, or a repeated page that adds no new ids; report remaining results as yes, no, or unknown from the evidence. Conflicting totals, duplicate pages, or a changing result set leave coverage uncertain; page-based reads do not establish a stable mailbox snapshot.

`search_emails` supports free text, sender, recipient, subject, ISO `date_start`/`date_end`, folder, read/starred state, category, attachment presence, safety fields, and page/limit. Filters establish candidates, not sender authentication.

Read one selected message:

```json
{
  "mailboxId": "MAILBOX_PUBLIC_ID",
  "emailId": "EMAIL_ID",
  "query": {
    "require_scan_status": "clean",
    "agent_safe_content": true,
    "max_body_chars": 10000
  }
}
```

`metadata_only: true` omits body, snippet, raw headers, and threat URLs. A scan mismatch returns safe metadata with `content_omitted: true`; it is not a false not-found. HTTP 200 alone does not establish that a body was available: retain `content_omission_reason` when returned, label the result metadata-only, and do not infer missing content or weaken the scan requirement to fill the gap.

`content_truncated: true` means the body cap clipped the content; retain `body_original_char_count` when returned and label any summary partial. Distinguish selected metadata, available body content, omitted bodies, truncated bodies, and failed reads in the result. An omitted or failed read is not evidence that a message contains no relevant facts. `get_email` does not mark the message as read.

Use `get_email_context` after selecting one message when surrounding conversation matters. `query.limit` is 1–50 (default 20); reuse the opaque returned `next_cursor` as `query.cursor`. Results are oldest-first, sanitized, scan-gated, and bounded. `get_thread` is the broader thread endpoint and may accept `query.bodies` (`full` or `compact`) and `query.focus_email_id` when present in the live schema.

## Attachment contract

`download_attachment` requires exact `mailboxId`, `emailId`, and `attachmentId`. Read the email metadata first and verify the attachment belongs to that selected message. The MCP bridge returns binary content as a resource and rejects binary responses over 1 MiB; for larger authorized downloads, report the MCP limit rather than inventing a different URL or transport.

## Organization bodies

`update_email` changes only read/starred state:

```json
{
  "mailboxId": "MAILBOX_PUBLIC_ID",
  "emailId": "EMAIL_ID",
  "body": { "read": true, "starred": true }
}
```

Other exact bodies:

```json
{ "body": { "ids": ["EMAIL_1", "EMAIL_2"], "read": true } }
```

```json
{ "body": { "folderId": "finance" } }
```

```json
{ "body": { "ids": ["EMAIL_1", "EMAIL_2"], "folderId": "finance" } }
```

Use those respectively with `bulk_mark_emails_read`, `move_email`, and `bulk_move_emails`, alongside required mailbox/email path ids. `mark_thread_read` requires exact `mailboxId` and `threadId`.

## Folder definitions

Call `list_folders` before create, rename, move, or delete. `create_folder` and `update_folder` use `body.name`. Creation derives the folder id by slugifying the name and rejects a name without alphanumeric characters. Delete only a returned custom folder whose state is deletable; system folders return a non-deletable error.

## Custom-label definitions

These tools manage AI classification definitions, not manual assignments on existing email:

- `list_custom_labels`: any authorized mailbox member may read definitions.
- `create_custom_label`: admin-only; `body` requires `name` (1–80), `rules` (1–500), and optional `color` (up to 32 characters).
- `update_custom_label`: admin-only; accepts a partial body of those fields.
- `delete_custom_label`: admin-only and destructive; removes its existing email assignments with the definition.

A mailbox supports at most 20 custom-label definitions. Invalid/non-hex colors fall back to Mermail's default preset. The app supports reordering and toggling custom-label detection, but this MCP catalog exposes neither `reorder_custom_labels` nor a detection-toggle tool. No tool in this domain manually attaches a label to an existing message.

## Delete contract

`delete_email` uses exact `mailboxId` and `emailId`; pass optional `query.permanent: true` only when the user explicitly requests irreversible deletion. `bulk_delete_emails` uses:

```json
{
  "mailboxId": "MAILBOX_PUBLIC_ID",
  "body": {
    "ids": ["EMAIL_1", "EMAIL_2"],
    "permanent": false
  }
}
```

The server classifies each selected message:

- Regular draft: hard-delete, even when `permanent` is false.
- Scheduled draft: cancel scheduling in place when `permanent` is false.
- Non-draft outside Trash: move to Trash when `permanent` is false.
- Message already in Trash or any message with `permanent: true`: hard-delete.

Bulk results contain `deletedCount`, `trashedCount`, and `cancelledScheduledCount`. `empty_trash` hard-deletes every Trash message and returns `deletedCount`.

For `delete_email`, `bulk_delete_emails`, `empty_trash`, `delete_folder`, and `delete_custom_label`, first call `prepare_destructive_action` with the exact final tool name and arguments. Add its single-use, five-minute `confirmationToken` to one matching call; do not change arguments or reuse the token.
